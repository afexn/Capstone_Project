# Capstone_Project

# Overview
To visualize the data set for this project, I used interactive plots from pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. This data set contains information on 210 countries' responses to the effects of COVID-19 on the global economy.

The COVID-19 virus's effects have significantly altered the international economy as it spreads around the world. I determine how much COVID-19 has an impact on the world economy. In order to measure changes in the global market and its association with COVID-19 cases, I take into account COVID-19 daily confirmed cases and gdp per capita data within the COVID-19 timeframe.

The analysis's primary goal is to make predictions. In order to determine the association between the general GDP, the human development index, and the overall death rate, I will use linear regression techniques in this research. The best candidate algorithm will then be selected from the first results. Building a model that precisely predicts how each nation's global economy will be affected is the aim of this project.

# Methods
using Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, StandardScaler, Pipeline with split functions & k-fold method. The k-fold cross validation method is used to evaluate how effectively the method performed on data.

# Conclusion 
Due to pandamic, the provided data cannot accurately reflect the global market's true impact. Due to a lack of equipment in some developing countries, there aren't enough cases to report. On the other hand, developed nations have sufficient testing facilities and offer more cases for both testing and showing. Perhaps gathering more frequent data on specific countries might help to produce more precise results when predicting the impact on GDP for a particular country.

As a result, I would consider using the Ridge model, as it best fits the data in terms of accuracy scores.

# Tools Used
